#### In this data cleaning project, I have parsed, dropped and renamed columns. Moreover, I changed values manually. Regex would have been very helpful but still learning how to use it correctly.
#### The steps I followed are these: 
* Import data
* Used df.loc to change values mannually. 
* Parse columns Named_by, Period_name and lenght
* Merging the tables to a unique data base
* Export to Excel
